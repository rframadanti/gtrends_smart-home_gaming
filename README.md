Keywords relative popularity over time and region from Google Trends API data

Google Trends shows the relative popularity of a search term or query and is a very handy and powerful tool to gain insights from.

To get started, I collected data of 72 keywords indicating products of smart home & gaming devices from Google Trends API using pytrends library in Python. All values are relative to each other's popularity (not actual search volume). 

Key insights from it:
1. Pattern of popularity surge every December, indicating seasonality (Christmas presents, anyone?). 
2. Shifting trends: obsolete models are replaced by newer ones.
3. Some products are only popular in certain regions (could be niche) and most have higher popularity in developed and developing countries.
4. The most popular category, gaming consoles, such as “PlayStation 4”, are more widespread and tend to have significantly higher popularity in countries where other categories are not as likely to be searched.

Feel free to explore this DataViz that I created in Tableau, play around with the interactive filter and see if you can find more interesting patterns and insights from it!
